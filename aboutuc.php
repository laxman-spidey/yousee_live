<h3>UC Community</h3>	
<p>The work at UC is supported by a community of people who share an interest to support and promote the work that UC platform supports. This community consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Core Team</b> which anchors the work at UC and also coordinates the efforts with all the other team members. It is comprised of</li>
<ul>
<li>Fulltime Volunteers</li>
<li>Employees</li>
<li>Fulltime Volunteers/Employees on Sabbatical with UC</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Volunteers</b> comprising of</li>
<ul>
<li>Students</li>
<li>Working People</li>
<li>Retired People</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Student Interns</b></li>
<li><b>Board</b></li>
</ol>

<h3>Student Interns</h3>
<p>Student Interns are an integral part of UC team and have contributed with their skills and efforts to take UC's work forward. We welcome interns to work with UC with the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunity to apply knowledge and skills to community service</li>
<li>Gain new skills and knowledge by doing onground work</li>
<li>Opportunity to contribute to positive social change</li>
</ul>	
<p>We recommend internship engagements to be not less than 3 weeks full-time participation in a project. Most projects at UC require real-time execution work, often requiring interns to multitask besides handling some core responsibilities. </p>
<p>Current opportunities range from coordinating, executing and documenting some of UC's and its partners projects. A range of skill sets from communication skills, project management, programming etc would be needed in such projects. Team Work, Empathy, Patience and Perseverance are key to UC's work, which is collaborative in nature.</p>
<p>Internships at UC are undertaken on a voluntary basis, integrating into the giving spirit that UC promotes. UC makes an effort to cover some of the travel and other incidental expenses that interns might incur as part the project work. Any such reimbursements covered are indicated by UC with respect to each project, based on its budgetary provisions. </p>
<p>Students who wish to explore internship projects with UC can contact UC by writing to gunaranjan@yousee.in </p>
<p>We wish to acknowledge the contributions made by students who have worked on UC projects in the past and we list them below:</p>

<h3>Join the Core Team</h3>

<p>UC welcomes members to join the UC Core team as fulltime Giving Ambassadors, either on entirely voluntary basis or with a very modest financial compensation. While some may take financial compensation for their work at UC, they volunteer to take a modest compensation that is primarily to help them meet their basic livelihood needs. Embodying this spirit in the core team is a strategic necessity for them to lead and develop the collaborative and voluntary platforms that UC aims to build for its work in the social development sector.</p>
<p>Here are some attributes we are looking for when someone chooses to join the UC core team.</p>
<ol>
<li>Strong inclination for social work</li>
<li>Open minded and quick at learning</li>
<li>Aptitude for field work and project execution</li>
<li>Willingness to constructively debate on ideas, issues and challenges</li>
<li>Good team worker and  communicator</li>
<li>Good documentation skills</li>
<li>Reasonably good analytical and quantitative skills</li>
<li>At ease with travel to different parts of the country for extended periods</li>
<li>Having some work experience would be helpful</li>
<li>Prepared for a modest compensation</li>
<li>Multitasker (a necessity given UC's multidimensional work and its early stage of growth)</li>
<li>Self Starter (should be able to plan by oneself without expecting micro level instructions and communicate well with team and partners to get tasks accomplished)</li>
</ol>

<p>UC is a giving platform, which invites resources in the form of volunteering time, waste donations and financial donations, to be deployed for result oriented social development work. UC team members would stand out as Ambassadors of Giving, through their own contribution of efforts for the activities undertaken by UC and also by taking a very modest compensation. UC encourages the team member to assess the minimum compensation that they would need to be independent, discharge their responsibilities and maintain good health. UC would finalise the compensation based on its budget feasibility and if the desired compensation is modest, reflecting the Giving spirit.</p>
