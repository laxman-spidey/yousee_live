<h1>Donate your Books</h1>
<p>During the monthly waste donation camps held at different communities in Hyderabad during 2011, we have received several reusable books which have been distributed to NGO partners. We see a potential for book donations to benefit several students and NGOs working with the underprivileged. Starting the summer of 2012, UC will be organising exclusive Book Donation camps with the support of volunteers in Hyderabad and we look forward to start this initiative in all the major cities of India too. Please do contact 9000183123 or gunaranjan@yousee.in for information on this initiative. We are currently working on developing IT applications to present information of books donated and distributed. Given below are live updates of donations received at Hyderabad through this initiative.</p>
